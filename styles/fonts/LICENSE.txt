# DJR End User License Agreement

## Multi-use License

This End User License Agreement is a legal agreement between **you**, the licensee, and **me** (DJR Type LLC, or DJR for short). Please read it carefully.

When you purchase a font from me, you are granted a non-exclusive license to use the font. 

This agreement takes effect when you download or use the font, and is governed by the laws of the State of Massachusetts. I expressly reserve all rights not granted to you in this agreement. If you do not agree to or understand these terms, do not download or use the font. 

Fonts: For the purposes of this license, a “font” is defined as the font software, the designs embodied therein, and all supplemental materials provided along with the font software, as well as any future versions or upgrades.

Limitations: This license is governed by “limitations” that define the maximum number of allowed font desktop computer installations, unique website visitors for websites using the font, and number of mobile apps and e-books using the font. The limitations of your license can be found in your Order Summary. If you do not have an Order Summary, if your order summary includes the phrase “For testing purposes only,”, or if a specific use is not defined, the assumed limitation is zero (0). You restricted to using the font only for internal testing purposes, and must upgrade to a full and appropriate license before delivering or publishing any work that uses the font.



## General Terms

You are permitted to use the font for personal and internal business use. 

Protection: This font is protected under United States copyright and trademark law.

Distribution: Except in very specific instances described and permitted in this license, you may not distribute (share, rent, lend, give away, or sell) the font. You agree to take all reasonable steps to prevent others from accessing, distributing, or re-serving the font file.

Modifications: You are allowed to convert text set in the font into outlined vector files. You may also subset and modify the font software itself for your own purposes; any derived versions of the font remain the property of DJR and are subject to the same license and limitations. I also also ask that you notify me of major modifications so that I can consider making similar changes in the released version.

License Transfer: You are allowed to transfer this license to another individual, company, or organization so long as the following conditions are met: 

* The transferee must agree to the terms of this license. 
* You must delete all copies of the font that you possess or control.
* You must notify me of the transfer and provide the name and contact information for the transferee.

Upgrades: If any of your uses exceed of your defined limitations, you must contact me to purchase an upgrade for your license.

Special uses: You must obtain a license extension if you wish to use the font in any way not identified in this license. This includes use in broadcasting, use in alphabet products where an unlicensed user has access to the alphabet in full, and in products where an end-user can set type using the font or distribute products with customized uses of the font.

Credit: You are not obligated to include a colophon or credit the font or its designer, but are more than welcome to do so.

## Terms of Desktop Use

This license allows you to install and use the font on a limited number of workstations defined in your order summary. All of these workstations must belong to the same individual, company, or organization that is licensing the font. Desktop uses include, but are not limited to, the design of printed materials, logos, and static images.

Document embedding: You are allowed to embed the font in document formats that allow font embedding, such as PDF. The font must be embedded in such a way that the reader is restricted from changing its embedding permissions, extracting the complete font from the document, and create or edit new content using the font. Embedding in mobile apps or e-books is subject to a separate set of terms and limitations.

Service Bureaus: If printing from an embedded PDF is not an option, you are permitted to send the font to a printer or service bureau that is creating the final output of your design. When the service bureau is finished printing your job, they must destroy all copies of the font.

Internal servers: You may install the font on an internal server as long as you do not exceed the total number of workstations defined in your order summary.

Backups: You may create a copy of the desktop font for backup purposes, as long as the backup copy cannot be accessed by anyone other than licensed users.


## Terms of Web Use

This license allows you to use the font on websites using CSS @font-face, so long as that website meets the web traffic limits defined in your order summary.

Web traffic: You are allowed to serve the font, in web font formats, on a website that receives a limited number of unique visitors per month as defined in your order summary. If unique visitors are not recorded for your website, you may alternatively measure your traffic by monthly pageviews. If you exceed your limit for three consecutive months, you must upgrade your license. I reserve the right to inspect or monitor your use.

Domains: I ask that you identify and register all domains where the font is served via @font-face. You may [contact me]({{base}}/) at any time to register an additional domain. You are not limited to a specific number of domains or subdomains, so long as all websites using the font are operated by you, and the cumulative traffic does not exceed your web traffic limitation. 

Formats: You may only serve web fonts in WOFF, WOFF2, EOT, and SVG formats. 

Server: You must host the font on your website's server or on a CDN (content delivery network) where you host other website assets. You must make a reasonable effort to prevent unauthorized use or distribution of the font. If the server’s directory structure is publicly listed or searchable, you must include the text of this license alongside the hosted files and clearly mark them as licensed assets.

## Terms of App/E-book Use

This license allows you to distribute the font by embedding it in a limited number of apps or e-books specified in your order summary. 

Platforms: Platform-specific versions with the same name and functionality may be counted together as a single app. 
On each platform, you must make a reasonable effort to secure the font and prevent it from unauthorized use. 

## Finally

Rights: I reserve all rights not otherwise specified, make no guarantees, and disclaim all warranties except those proscribed by law.

Termination: This agreement remains in effect until the license is terminated. If the license is terminated, you must discontinue use of the font and delete all copies that you control or possess.

If you wish to terminate this agreement, simply notify me and delete the font. If you choose to terminate a license within 30 days of your original purchase, I will refund your payment.

I reserve the right to terminate the license if you breach any term of this agreement, without the obligation of notice or opportunity to cure. That said, I will make a good faith effort to allow you to upgrade your license so that you can operate within its terms. Grounds for termination include:

* Using the font outside of the terms set in this license
* Exceeding the agreed-upon limitations without purchasing an upgrade
* Unauthorized distribution of the font, or other breaches of the terms stated above

Liability: Under no circumstances am I responsible or liable for any issues or harm or physical damages that may result from the use of the font, even if notified in advance.

If you encounter a problem with the font, I will make a good faith effort to provide you with documentation and support. If no solution can be found, I can offer you the option to terminate the license in exchange for a refund. A refund is not guaranteed in every instance and is up to my discretion.

Legal Use: I reserve all rights to modify, enforce, and terminate this license to the extent that it is permitted by law. You are responsible for making sure that you are in compliance with all laws, foreign and domestic, that might apply to its purchase and use.

Questions: If you have any questions or concerns about this license, contact me at any time at <david@djr.com>.

Thank you for abiding by the terms of this agreement, and I hope you enjoy using the font!
